# Simpson's Rule and Trapezium Method Comparison Paper

I compared Simpson's Rule and the trapezium method's accuracy and error for power functions, plotting with matplot.lib and proving why Simpson's Rule surprisingly
perfectly integrates power functions up to the power 3 despite consisting of power 2 functions.

The paper culminates in a model of the error produced by Simpson's Rule as a function of number of segments used and the power of the power function.
